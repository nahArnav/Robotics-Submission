## Coding

### Hold button code
This is code for blinking LED when the push button is kept pressed (Held at HIGH constantly).
To see blinking effect of LED using this code we need to keep the button pressed. 
As soon as the button is released, the led turn off and no blinking effect can be seen.

### Click button code
In this code I tried to replace the need of holding the button with just needing to click the button once for the blinking effect.

### Research
Research on OpenCV and YOLO models.
