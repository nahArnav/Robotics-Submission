<h1 align="center">Motor Drivers</h1>
### A Motor Driver is an integrated circuit (IC) or module that acts as an intermediate "bridge" between a microcontroller and a motor. It amplifies low-current control signals from the microcontroller into the high-current and high-voltage power required to drive motors, while isolating sensitive logic circuits from electrical damage.
