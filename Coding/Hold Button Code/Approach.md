In this program, I started by thinking how to make the LED react to the button.
For this I used digitalRead() and HIGH and LOW to check the button's current status(if it's pressed or not).
I even went through some examples that come with the arduino IDE, which gave me the idea of how to make the LED blink.
So, by combining both the button's code logic and the button blink logic, I made this code.
