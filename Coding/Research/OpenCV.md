## 1.Explain what OpenCV is and its role in robot vision.
### OpenCV, an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library, provides a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and accelerates the adoption of machine perception in commercial products.  With over 2500 optimised algorithms encompassing both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning techniques, OpenCV offers a wide range of functionalities.  These include face and object detection, video action classification, camera and object tracking, 3D model extraction, stereo camera point cloud generation, image stitching for high-resolution scene creation, image database similarity searches, red-eye removal, eye tracking, scenery recognition, and augmented reality marker overlay.  OpenCV boasts a large user community of hundreds of thousands and boasts monthly downloads exceeding 40 million.  Its extensive use spans companies, research groups, hobbyists, and even governmental bodies like NASA.
