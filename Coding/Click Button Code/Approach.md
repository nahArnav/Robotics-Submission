I was actually just going to submit the hold button code because I thought that's what was asked for initially, but then I thought it can also mean a code that involves just clicking the button once to toggle between the blink mode and off mode.
So, I tried implementing a code for this type of program too.
I tried using a key and a lastbuttonstate variable to compare the current state of the button to its last state.
If a change in state is observed, the control structure would switch between blink and off mode.
I simulated the program too but for some reason the simulation was very unpredictable, sometimes the effect would work and sometimes it wouldn't.
I think it's either the simulator's fault or there's some error in my code.
I searched up similar programs to get to know how to implement this and there was a function called "debounce" used in the programs.
I decided not to use it in my program and turn in my original code because it felt a little out of scope to me.
